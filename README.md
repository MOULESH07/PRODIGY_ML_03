🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM

This project is part of Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship – Task 3.
The task is to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from a dataset and assess its accuracy.

📌 Project Overview
Preprocess images using OpenCV
Extract features using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
Train an SVM classifier
Evaluate accuracy of the model

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
scikit-learn
scikit-image
NumPy

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Microsoft Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset, available at:
🔗 [Cats and Dogs Dataset (Microsoft)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)
It contains:
Cat images 🐱
Dog images 🐶

🚀 Steps Involved
Load and preprocess the dataset
Convert images to grayscale and resize them
Extract HOG features
Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Test and evaluate the classifier
